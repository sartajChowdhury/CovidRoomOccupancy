The design is inspired by the quarentine protocols that arised from Covid-19, and so the sensor subsystem we have developed will be able to detect people passing through a doorway, which could be useful in setting up a biosecure bubble (where it is necessary to keep track of people). Similarly, this could be useful for on-campus events/activities, such as when students/people are entering/exiting buildings. This could enable tracking the spread of covid-19 as certain areas would be best to avoid at a particular time due to crowding. This system detects how many people have entered/exited the door via a counter, and can account for multiple people walking through, and people passing through in different directions. 
The system includes 4 HW-201 IR avoidance sensors and 2 TOF sensors. There are 2 PCBs, each of which contains 2 IR sensors and 1 TOF sensor. One of the PCB contains an ESP-32. Both PCBs are placed on opposite ends of the door frame with a height offset. The wiring goes above the door. The mounted ESP is connected via wifi to another ESP that updates the count as and when required. The mounting was done with the help of cardboard which was taped to the sides of the doorframe.
